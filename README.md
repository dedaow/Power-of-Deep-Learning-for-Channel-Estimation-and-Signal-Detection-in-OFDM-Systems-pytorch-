## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the authors of the following repositories:

- [OFDM_DNN by haoyye — original implementation from the paper](https://github.com/haoyye/OFDM_DNN.git)  
- [BUG423/KAN_OFDM](https://github.com/BUG423/KAN_OFDM.git)  
- [DNN_detection_via_keras by TianLin0509](https://github.com/TianLin0509/DNN_detection_via_keras)

I learned a lot from the second and third repositories, and based on my understanding, I have written a simplified version using PyTorch. As a beginner, there may be mistakes — feedback and suggestions are very welcome!
